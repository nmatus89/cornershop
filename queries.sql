-- Question 1 Calculate the number of orders per day of the week, distinguishing if the orders are on_demand.
SELECT dow, count(on_demand)
FROM orders
JOIN order_product
ON orders.order_id = order_product.order_id
WHERE on_demand = 'true' 
group by dow
order by dow;

SELECT dow, count(on_demand)
FROM orders
JOIN order_product
ON orders.order_id = order_product.order_id
WHERE on_demand = 'false' 
group by dow
order by dow;

--Question 2 Calculate the average quantity of distinct products that each order has, grouped by store
select store, avg(quantity)
from order_product
join orders
on orders.order_id = order_product.order_id
join storebranch
on orders.store_branch_id = storebranch.store_branch_id
group by store
order by avg(quantity) asc;

-- Question 3 Calculate the average found rate(*) of the orders grouped by the product format and day of the week.
select dow, avg(shoppers.found_rate), buy_unit
from shoppers
join orders
on orders.picker_id = shoppers.picker_id
join order_product
on orders.order_id = order_product.order_id
group by dow, buy_unit
order by buy_unit asc;

-- Question 4 Calculate the average error and mean squared error of our estimation model for each hour of the day.
